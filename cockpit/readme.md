# DIY Mobile Fab Lab cockpit-like control panel

## Readability

While driving readability is very important as distractions can lead to accidents.

- [B612] is an highly legible open source font family designed by Airbus and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens
- Futura Medium (and Futura Medium Condensed for smaller areas) are the fonts used in Boeing panels
