# Elegoo Mars 2 Pro

## Buildplate

- Use 2-3 coats of rainx or WS40 PTFE on the top to facilitate resin drain

## Resin tank

- Use 2-3 coats of rainx or WS40 PTFE on the FEP to avoid adhesion

### Magnetic flexible build plate

- Home sensor must be spaced by about 3mm
- Borders of the buildplate must be filed to avoid FEP damage
- Tab must be placed at the back side of the build plate to avoid crash against the tank

## Lychee

- Make sure orientation allows resin drainage
- Make sure support adhesion/resistance is stronger than FEP adhesion at all times

## Consumables

- Use gloves without powder
- Use isopropyl spray
- Use PP honeycomb to hold parts on the table/curing plattform

## Future hacks

- Install rails on back of machine to raise/lower the cover
