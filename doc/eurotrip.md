# Eurotrip

One of my many unfulfilled dreams is to make a trip across europe visiting rural locations where fab labs and many other resources do not reach. 

## Path and time

- 26000 km
- At 400 km a day
- 65 driving days
- 1.5-2 full days per spot
- 25 spots
- 37 days
- Total 100 days
- 3.3 months

## Cost

- Fuel 5000 eur
- Ferries 3000 eur
- Tolls 500 eur
- Stays 80x20 = 1600 eur
- Food 100x10=1000 eur
- Total 11000 eur

## Approach

It might be a better approach to create a series of smaller trips

- Circle 0: test
- Circle 1: local
- Circle 2: Catalonia
- Circle 3: Spain and Portugal
- Circle 4: Europe
