## Introduction, skip if you are straight to the point.
Outside the atmosphere, the [solar irradiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance) is about 1350 W/m2, that is called the [solar constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_constant). This radiation crosses the Earths's atmosphere and finally it reaches around 1000 W/m2. Now, the exact number depends on the location. The device that measures solar radiation is called [Pyranometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyranometer). It actually costs a lot of money but you could build one yourself. There are radiation maps where you can also check this data.

Now another factor to consider when designing a solar installation is the peak sun hours in your location and season. Because the sun only gives that much energy during these peak hours. The rest of the hours there is much less energy.

## Equipment needed
You will need:
* A solar panel. You have to get a monocristline panel. Because they are the most efficient and you are in a reduced space.
* A charge regulator. Get one with LCD.
* A battery. Get a gel one. You don't want sulfuric acid leaking in your car, do you?
* An inverter
